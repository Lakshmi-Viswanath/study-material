REST API
APIs that follow the REST guidelines is called REST APIs. The guidelines to prepare the good APIs
1. REST prefers a client and server communication should happen over HTTP.
2. REST prefers JSON as the format to send and receive data.
3. Gives the guidelines on how the URLs should look like.
4. In REST the main source of information is considered as a resource. Endpoints/URL should be a noun 
and not action verb.The nouns that we mention are expected to be plural.
5. Every REST endpoint should be defined along with HTTP methods like GET, POST, DELETE, PACTH, PUT
6. REST expects to have API versioning and HTTP codes.
7. We use nesting for relationships and not more that 3 levels of nesting is suggested.
